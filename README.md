# Python Word Dictionary

This project returns the meaning of the word based on the data file.

The words or the phrases are stored in the "data.json" file. When the user enters a word, the script looks for the word in the file, if not find, it uses the "get_close_matches" library to find the closest match to the entered word and prompts if it is the word.

The script can return mutiple meaning of the words having more than one meaning.
